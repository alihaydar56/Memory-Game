                                          WEB DESÄ°NG TERM PROJECT 2
First of all I created html page then I used css style to make more beatiful view
then I used transfrom transition effect to flip the cards.
To match the cards I gave data-framework properities and same name to the same pictures.
when user click a card card will be open until user click second card if both card's data-framework are 
same,then both cards's click properites will be removed from the card,otherwise they will turn their back position
to use timer I used setTimeInterval the timer will start while user click a card and user can click card until time is over
and I also add point categories if cards match then user will get 10 point.
I made all mission successfully which you accept us.
